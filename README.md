### Trello Location Optimizer Bot
This Python bot automates the task of organizing Trello cards based on their geographical locations. It extracts location information from the cards in a Trello list, optimizes the order of these locations based on driving directions (starting from a specified origin point), and rearranges the cards accordingly. The goal is to create a more efficient route for users, minimizing travel time between locations.

# Features
Location Extraction: Automatically pulls location data from each Trello card in a specified list.
Path Optimization: Uses driving directions to compute the most efficient route starting from an origin location.
Card Rearrangement: Reorders the Trello cards to reflect the optimized location sequence, making it easier for users to follow the best path.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Trello API credentials
Google Maps API (or any other API for driving directions)
Required Python libraries:
requests
googlemaps
py-trello
# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/trello-location-optimizer.git
cd trello-location-optimizer

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your API keys for both Trello and Google Maps by adding them to the .env file:

TRELLO_API_KEY=your_trello_api_key
TRELLO_TOKEN=your_trello_token
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Usage

Define the origin location (starting point) in your code or via input.
Run the bot:
python optimize_trello_locations.py

The bot will:
Extract the locations from your Trello card list.
Optimize the order of locations for driving efficiency.
Rearrange the Trello cards in the new optimized sequence.

# Future Improvements

Integration with other mapping services for location optimization.
Support for additional transportation modes (e.g., walking, cycling).
Improved error handling and logging.
